# comp473s19project2

This is the repository for Project 2 of COMP 363/463, offered by Loyola University Chicago in Spring 2019. The owners of this project are Jess Conway and Sophie Von Hatten. The official guidelines for the assignment can be found in the Specifications folder.

The primary difference between this and the code found in comp473s19project1 is that this code is wired using Spring. Other improvements include a reformatting of the package structure and a reversal of the interaction between the view, business, and data layers.

The easiest way to interact with this repo is to compile and run Driver.java using the Eclipse IDE. This will create a test object of each type and make a call to each of the methods in the DAL, in effect testing the entire project.

The initial submission of this project was made on 24 Feb 2019.
